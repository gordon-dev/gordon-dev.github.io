## Project Manager / Aspiring Programmer / Dad / Etc.

I have several projects that I plan to host on this site.

### Interest
- Arduino 
- C development
- Java development
- Technology project management

I believe the majority of software development struggles originate from 3 places:
1. The business doesn't understand enough about technology to know what to ask for.
2. The process of turning business requests into well formed requirements documentation is broken, and produces vague requirements. 
3. The development teams don't understand enough about the business side to interpret the vague requirements.

But wait, what if the Project Manager could actually code?...

# Understand the business
## Understand the developers
### Deliver amazing projects
